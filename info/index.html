<div class="page-text"><p>This page is made to document my learning of p5.js and creative coding by displaying some animations I made which include playful user interactions. This is it's purpose for now. I got the idea in the course "Intro to Web-Coding" by Johannes Schmoll at UdK Berlin. Here I read the text <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com/e/my-website-is-a-shifting-house" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">&quot;My website is a shifting house&quot;</a> by Laurel Schwulst, which inspired a great fury of thoughts, what a website could be, needs to be, how it should look and many other things, upon which I tried to come up with a few interesting concepts and this one stuck. It's made with the help of Kirby CMS. Then a plugin is used to generate a static version of the page, which for now has not caused any weird troubles. These static files are then stored in a GitHub repository and published with github-pages and served on a domain with the same name as the repository.</p></div>
